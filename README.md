# Backtracking-Islands

Given a matrix where each element can be 0 or 1. 
Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, 
vertically, or diagonally. The connected cells that are filled with 1s form a region 
(also called island or cluster).  There may be several regions in the matrix.  
This backtracking algorithm finds the largest region.
